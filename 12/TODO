- Fix gender in some languages, e.g. "dva miliardy".
  This can be achieved using either context aware gettext (not available
  in clean Python yet, available in e.g. Django), or by using a workaround -
  translating affected strings manually (translating "two billion" as one
  string instead of splitting it to "two" and "billion", in the same way
  hundreds are translated in the program)

  https://bugs.python.org/issue2504 - Add gettext.pgettext() and variants
  support

- Fix unnecessary spaces in e.g. German

- tests, including translations

- setup.py
  - classic setup + automatic message catalogs compilation ('babel' package
  could help)

- docs
